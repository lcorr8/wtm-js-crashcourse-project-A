# Week 6


## Questions
1. if each test has to create a meetup what is the proper way to refactor that into a function or something and call it at the beginning of each test (then a new one would be created each time for each test but you wouldnt have to copy paste it all over the place?) 
    - i couldnt get a beforeEach functionality working on the tests
